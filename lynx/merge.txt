# Lynx Merge List
# Lynx is preprocessed with itself, but can't be run on a standard Lox
# interpreter because it is split into multiple modules. This file contains a
# list of every module used by Lynx in the order they should be included. This
# allows a usable bootstrap version of Lynx to be built before it is
# preprocessed.

# List collection:
<collections/list/node>
<collections/list/iterator>
<collections/list>

# Map collection:
<collections/map/node>
<collections/map/iterator>
<collections/map>

# Log:
log/char.lox
log/log_record.lox
log/log.lox

# Config:
config/config.lox

# Token:
token/token_type.lox
token/token.lox

# Scanner:
scanner/scanner.lox

# Tests:
# These tests should only be included in the bootstrap version of Lynx. The
# tests will run before the main function, and may exit with an exit code if any
# of the tests fail.
