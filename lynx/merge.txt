# Lynx Merge List
# Lynx is preprocessed with itself, but can't be run on a standard Lox
# interpreter because it is split into multiple modules. This file contains a
# list of every module used by Lynx in the order they should be included. This
# allows a usable bootstrap version of Lynx to be built before it is
# preprocessed.

# Standard library:
<call_main>

# Temporary modules:
temp/get_message.lox

# Main:
main.lox
